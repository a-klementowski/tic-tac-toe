# tic-tac-toe

This repository contains an implementation of the game of Tic-Tac-Toe in MIPS assembly language. 
The code provides a simple text-based user interface for playing the game.

The tic_tac_toe.asm file contains the main code for the game. 
To run the game, assemble the code using a MIPS assembler, and then load the resulting binary file onto a MIPS processor.

This code was written as part of a university course on computer architecture and assembly language programming.
